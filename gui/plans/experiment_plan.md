# 📄 Comparison Results Page Plan

## **Experiment Info**

* **Experiment ID:**
* **Experiment Date:**

---

## **📊 Comparison Groups**

### **Groups Defined**

not just 2 groups, any number of groups here

#### **Group 1 (Name)**

* **Rats:** 1 rat — *list them*
* **Regions:** 1 region — *list them*
* **Associated ROIs:** *(collapsible)*

  * List of strings (paths) presented as a bullet list inside a collapsible element.

#### **Group 2 (Name)**

* **Rats:** 1 rat — *list them*
* **Regions:** 1 region — *list them*
* **Associated ROIs:** *(collapsible)*

  * List of strings (paths) presented as a bullet list inside a collapsible element.

---

## **🧠 Inference Results**

* **Main Result Image:**
  Image of inference results between the groups.
  Location:

  ```
  ./data/figures/experiment_id/inference_results/*.png
  ```

* **Per-Group Details** *(collapsible for each group)*:

  * Average density of points for that group
  * Associations between predicted density and individual ROIs in that group
  * `model_name` used for inference
  * Model expected RMSE for individual image patches

---

## **📈 Additional Information**

* **Model Performance Images:**
  Location:

  ```
  ./data/figures/experiment_id/model_performances/*.png
  ```

  Display all images one after another.

* **UI Feature:**
  All images should have an **"Open Image"** button to open in a new browser tab.

* **Future Expansion:**
  Maybe some other stuff later.
