### 2. Installation

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.8 or higher
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for deep learning components)
- 8GB+ RAM (16GB+ recommended for large datasets)

**Setup Instructions:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd projet
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **GPU Setup (optional but recommended):**
   - Ensure your NVIDIA Display Drivers are up to date.
   - Verify PyTorch GPU support: `python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"`
   
   *Note: If `torch.cuda.is_available()` returns `False` or you experience package-level CUDA issues, PyTorch may have defaulted to the CPU version. To fix this, manually install the CUDA-specific version:*
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
   ```

**Dependencies:**
The project relies on several key libraries including PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, scikit-image, and various scientific computing packages. See `requirements.txt` for the complete list.

### 4. Standard Workflow (Scripts & GUI)

For most users, the recommended way to use AxonSurvey is through our automated script pipeline and web GUI. This transforms the complex workflow into simple, executable steps:

1. **Setup**: Create the required folder structure (`scripts/1-setup_folder_structure.py`)
2. **Sample**: Extract image patches for training and testing (`scripts/2-sample_data.py`)
3. **Train**: Train the UNet segmentation model on annotated data (`scripts/3-train_model.py`)
4. **Infer**: Apply the trained model to all project images (`scripts/4-run_inference.py`)
5. **Analyze**: Launch the web-based Axon Survey GUI to explore and compare results (`gui/app.py`)

For a complete overview of these scripts and how to run them, please refer to the [Scripts Summary](scripts/0-scripts_summary.md) and the [Scripts README](scripts/README.md).

### 5. Detailed Workflow & Capabilities

Projects using this workflow can leverage the full capabilities of the codebase by following a similar series of steps:

1. **Data acquisition and structuring**
Images should be taken, then added to a repository structure as generated by `scripts/1-setup_folder_structure.py`. Each raw image can be manually separated in different ROIs, specific regions to seperate for quantification. Here's a video tutorial on this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ao4zGMchgY

2. **Sampling**
The `scripts/2-sample_data.py` script should have parameters set and be executed to sample from selected regions.
When sampling, some number of small fixed size image patches are taken. 
Currently, this sampling can only be done randomly, but future work could use informative features to guide that sampling process. This also may eventually lead to a slightly different workflow with two-fold sampling.

If models are to be trained in any way, create a train and a test dataset. If no training or fitting is required (only features are to be extracted from images) only a test set is necessary.

3. **Annotation**
Manually or semi-automatically create a segmentation mask from sampled images. In cases of axon quantification, this can be done by tracing axons with NeuronJ as showed in **Make a video**.

4. **Property definition**
In this project, we assume small image patches have measurable properties, that can be obtained from expert-annotations, and predicted with different models. These properties should be defined in code. This can be done in the form of a simple function that takes as input an image patch and outputs a property value, as defined in `src/utils/traceProps.py`.

5. **Extractor definition**
This can be done in parralel to the previous tasks. Specific extractors should be developped that have a chance at obtaining features from small image patches that are highly correlated with expert-annotations. This should be done with knowledge of the field and from previous works.

For example, for axon density quantification, we safely assume well-performing segmentation models create masks whose foreground density is highly correlated with human-expert axon tracing density. We also assume commonly used threshold algorithms create informative features for axon density.

It can also be useful to create simple baseline, with low expectations of performance, to validate minimal performance from other models.

6. **Training**
Externally train and fine tune models using training data. For segmentation projects where axon density is to be measured, this can be done quickly with the NNs module (via `scripts/3-train_model.py`), using a Unet Architecture and some predefined training parameters. For other projects, we leave to the user the responsibility of creating models that can accurately segment their specific images. 

7. **Validation and inference**
First define a list of models to test quantification performance, then, run through the steps of the automatic Inference Pipeline (using `scripts/4-run_inference.py`). This pipeline allows for measuring the performance of each selected model on each group that should be quantified. Then, the best model in each group is selected to predict the mean properties of each region in each group.
Finally, these results should be made available to the user, either in the form of empiric graph showing fixed point predictions for each region group (current approach using the **Axon Survey GUI**) or using statistical estimators and variance of the real population property mean using samples and model predictions given some assumptions (to develop in the future).

Can be first run in debug mode for generating more graphs than necessary. It should be useful to view model predictions on test data in that pipeline to make sure expectations for what each model is doing are being met. For example, simple RMSE graphs and inference graphs don't handle abberant images and predictions outside of normal ranges.
