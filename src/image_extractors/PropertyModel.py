    Class for estimating image properties. 
    This model can take as input an image of some size and output a prediction for one or multiple 'properties' (if fitted).
    Since these models must perform well on little training data (sets of around 100 images), they are made of 2 components : 
    - feature extractors; pretrained models/Harshly regularized models/deterministic processes/ that take as input an images
        and output low-dimensional vectors representing important features of this image (each extractor may output many)
    - feature_to_prop_model : A simple model (by default linear) to map extracted feature to the properties we want to estimate.
